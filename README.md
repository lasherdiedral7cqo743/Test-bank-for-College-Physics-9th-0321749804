  * This edition features the exact same content as the traditional text in a convenient, three-hole-punched, loose-leaf version. Books a la Carte also offer a great value for your students-this format costs 35% less than a new textbook. For more than five decades, Sears and Zemansky'sCollege Physics has provided the most reliable foundation of physics education for students around the world. The Ninth Edition continues that tradition with new features that directly address the demands on today's student and today's classroom. A broad and thorough introduction to physics, this new edition maintains its highly respected, traditional approach while implementing some new solutions to student difficulties. Many ideas stemming from educational research help students develop greater confidence in solving problems, deepen conceptual understanding, and strengthen quantitative-reasoning skills, while helping them connect what they learn with their other courses and the changing world around them.
